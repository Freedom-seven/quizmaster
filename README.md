<h1>Quiz Master</h1>

This is a quiz application built with React.js that allows users to test their knowledge on a variety of topics. The app features multiple-choice questions with feedback on correct and incorrect answers, a timer that limits the user's response time, and a score points counter that tracks the user's progress throughout the quiz. The timer ensures that the user is only able to answer questions within a given time frame, which adds an element of challenge to the quiz and encourages the user to answer quickly and accurately. At the end of the quiz, the user can see their final score and have the option to restart the quiz if they wish to try again.
